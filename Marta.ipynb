This process was realized considering the logic of having the first letter of the category in upper case followed by the remain letters in lower case. In case of *model*, there were some categories that did not necessarily correspond to a real model, but these incoherencies would be verified in the next stage. "

However, since we observed that some variables like *mpg* and *tax* had a considerable amount of missing values, the technique of removing the observations manually would not be a good option.\n",
    "Our approach consisted on checking the boxplots again (after handling incoherencies) and understanding what would be a valid maximum and minimum number for each feature. The observations whose value exceed the maximum number were replaced by missing values. In this way, we were able to keep the same number of features without loosing too much information. \n",

    "### 4.7. Treating Missing Values\n",
    "Considering that most of techniques used to handle incoherencies and treating outliers in numerical features consisted on replacing the numbers by missing values, we needed a good technique that was able to fill the missing values according to our dataset. Through the analysis made in the previous steps, we understood that if we want to fill a missing value of a certain variable, we cannot solely consider existent values of the same variable, we have to consider the rest of the variables of the dataset as well. For example, if our objective is to fill the *engineSize* of a certain observation, we should take into account its model and brand, assuming that is likely for a *Ford focus* to have the same or similiar engine size as other *Ford focus* that may exist in our dataset. \n",
    "For this reason, we have decided to fill numerical and categorical features using **Interactive Imputer** with **Extra Trees** as an estimator, which fill each variable with missing values using all the other variables as predictors. Moreover, *ExtraTrees* is abble to learn the nonlinear relationships present in our data and it captures interaction between variables. "

    "#### 4.7.1. Interative Imputer\n",
    "The first step to apply the interactive imputer was temporarily changing the categorical fetures to numerical using *Ordinal Encoding*. This action was required because the model that Iterative Imputer uses internally (in this case, *Extra Trees*) is a mathematical regression algorithm that can only operate on numeric features. We used *Ordinal Encoding* because missing values remain missing during the process and *Extra Trees* do not treat the encoded data as ordered values, it simply uses the numeric codes to split the data into groups.

    "Unlikely wrapper methods, *Random Forest Feature Importance* does not directly give us a set of optimal features, it inform us how much each feature contributes to improving the model’s predictions by reducing the variance of the target variable (price). When analysing the output of *RFFI*, it is possible to understand that importance values are relative, all the features sum to 1.0. This indicates that, the features that contribute the most for model’s predictive power are *transmission_Manual*, *year* and *engineEfficiency* with 29%, 19.3% and 18.9%, respectively. According to this method, these are the features that are frequently used to split nodes across many trees and the one the model relies heavily on to make predictions. On the other hand, *hasDamaged*, *fuelType_Other* and *fuelType_Hybrid* are the features used very little (or not at all) in the trees, which means they do not reduce the variance of price significantly. In order to decide what features to keep or discard based on this method, our reference number was 0.01, since every feature whose importance is below this value, does not add enough information to the model. Thus, based on this method, every feature should be kept except for **previousOwners**, **hasDamaged**, **fuelType_Petrol**, **transmission_Semi-Auto**, **fuelType_Hybrid** and **fuelType_Other**. "

    "Based on all the methods used and their individual conclusions, we have decided to build a table where for each feature, we analyse whether to keep or discard based on the method. Our approach to make this decision is based on whether the feature has 2 or more methods where was stated \"discard\". In case of having it 2 times, we would test the model with and without that feature, while the ones that have it more than 2 times would be automatically discarded. This implies that the features that have none or one \"discard\" are automatically included in the model. Moreover, considering that *RFECV* and *SFFS* are methods that provide an optimal number of features based on a specific set of variables, we have decided to also test the model with these groups of features, independently of the remain methods.
